# Contributing to CHalf
### Introduction

First off, thanks for being interested in contributing to CHalf!

Protein folding is crucial to structure and function. Understanding protein folding and misfolding has massive implications for health as well as for structural prediction and protein design. Unfortunately, protein folding stability has remained more of a niche subject in proteomics, often because it is difficult to get involved with. To measure folding stability, you need robust assays and good amount of programming skill to even get started. Our aim in developing the <b>Iodine Protein Stability Assay (IPSA)</b> and <b>CHalf</b> was to make stepping into protein folding stability simple. Your contributions to CHalf are essential to achieving this goal!

### How can I contribute?

- <b>Report Bugs -</b> If you find an issue, let us know so that we can get it fixed! Of course, be sure to check out the [Support Section](https://github.com/JC-Price/Chalf_public/blob/main/README.md#support) of the documentation before reporting an error, but if we haven't covered your issue, be sure to send us your project files with a screenshot of the error so that we can work on replicating the bug and making a patch.
- <b>Make and Share Tools -</b> If you make a useful tool for interpreting your CHalf outputs, let us and the community know! Science is collaborative. New tools will help increase the usefulness of stability measurements and will open the door for advances in the field. Who knows? Maybe your tool could even end up in the CHalf tools package (with proper credit of course).

Combined Residue Map Stats (.csv)
- Label@Site: Identifier indicating the label species and residue number
- Label: Label species on the labeled residue
- Site: Residue number for the labeled site
- Count_(Condition): Number of peptides used to calculate the combined site
- trim_CHalf_(Condition): C½ value of the site
- trim_CHalf_ConfidenceInterval_(Condition): Confidence interval of the C½ value of the site
- trim_slope_(Condition): Slope of the fitting curve for the C½ value of the site
